If you are curious about how Poseidon was made, you might be interested in some of the behind-the-scenes facts and trivia about the movie. For example, did you know that:
 
- The movie was shot mostly on a soundstage in Los Angeles, where a huge set of the ship's interior was built and flooded with water. The set was designed to rotate 360 degrees to create the illusion of the ship being upside down.
- The movie used a combination of practical and digital effects to create the rogue wave and the destruction of the ship. The wave was created by using a large water tank and a hydraulic system that could generate waves up to 40 feet high. The wave was then enhanced with computer-generated imagery (CGI) to make it look more realistic and menacing.
- The movie had a rigorous training program for the cast and crew, who had to undergo scuba diving lessons, swimming tests, and physical conditioning. The actors also had to perform most of their own stunts, which involved being submerged in water, climbing through narrow spaces, and jumping from heights.
- The movie had a cameo appearance by singer Fergie, who played Gloria, the entertainer on board the ship. She sang two songs in the movie: \"Bailamos\" and \"Won't Let You Fall\". The latter song was written by Fergie herself and was released as a single.

Poseidon was a challenging and ambitious movie to make, and it shows the dedication and talent of everyone involved. You can watch some of the behind-the-scenes footage and interviews on YouTube or on the DVD extras of the movie.
