- **DeNoise:** This plug-in can automatically or manually reduce stationary noise such as hiss, wind noise, buzz, and camera noise. It uses dynamic noise profiles that capture the characteristics of the noise over time, making it effective for reducing noise that fluctuates or varies randomly. The algorithm is also improved to avoid de-noising artifacts and preserve the quality of the original signal.
- **DeHum:** This plug-in can detect and remove hum and buzz caused by poorly grounded electrical equipment or other tonal noise sources. It can remove up to 96 harmonics and has a new Scan button that automatically fine-tunes the fundamental hum frequency. It also supports Mid/Side processing, which can reduce unwanted fluctuations in the stereo image.
- **DeClick:** This plug-in can remove impulsive noise such as clicks, crackle, and thumps that are often encountered on vinyl records or digital recordings with drop-outs or distorted data packets. It can also reduce plosives in vocal recordings. The algorithm is enhanced to avoid reducing attacks and transients in the desired signal. It also supports Mid/Side processing for stereo enhancement.
- **DeClip:** This plug-in can restore audio recordings that are distorted by analog or digital clipping. It can reconstruct the clipped peaks and smooth out the harsh distortion. The algorithm is improved to handle more severe clipping cases and preserve more details in the recovered signal.

Acon Digital Restoration Suite is compatible with Windows and Mac platforms and supports VST, VST3, AAX, and AU plug-in formats. It also supports sampling rates up to 192 kHz and surround and immersive multi-channel audio.
